Learning Python Cue Cards

Python is a great language to understand and learn and it fulfills part
of the Computing curriculum for KS2-4.
These cards can be used for presentations, or given to classes to work through.

These files are to be used in the context of learning Python 2.7, not 
Python 3.0.


You are free to reuse these cards and remix them to meet your needs, they are
